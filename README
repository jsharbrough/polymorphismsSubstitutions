To run program in unix terminal, type the following:

	python polymorphismsSubstitutions_v4.py <input> <ploidy>

		input	If ploidy is diploid, input should be a file of file names for all the alignments 
			for which you plan to obtain polymorphism and substitution counts. If input is 
			haploid (e.g., mtDNA sequence), input should be a single alignment file in fasta 
			format. Note that in haploid mode, you will need to adjust the positional 
			information in the two variables "regions" and "regionList" in the 
			polymorphismsSubstitutionsHaploid command. 

		ploidy	Ploidy is set to diploid on default. The two options are diploid and haploid. Note 
			that diploid state assumes the standerd genetic code and the haploid state assumes 
			the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. For diploid data, the program is 
			currently set up to only determine differences between two sequences in pairwise 
			fashion. If you wish to investigate polymorphism, please contact the developer.

Assumptions:

	*	For noncoding data, this program assumes that for sites with multiple hits, the number of 
		changes = # alleles -1. 

	*	For codons with multiple hits, the minimal number of changes possible to 
		explain the codon with # 
		changes/codon = (# site 1 alleles - 1) + (# site 2 alleles - 1) + (# site 3 alleles - 1). 

	*	If the number of changes was > 2, the codon will be sent to the logfile for manual 
		determination. 

	*	If there were three codons present and were all equally distantly related (e.g., AAA, AAT, 
		AAC), the codon will be sent to the logfile for manual determination. 

	*	If there aret hree codons and one codon was equally similar to the other two, but the other 
		two codons were more dissimilar, the codon sharing the highest degree of similarity is 
		assumed to be the 	evolutionary intermediate (e.g., AAA(K) <--> ACA(T) <--> ACT(T), 
		yielding 1 synonymous change and 1 nonsynonymous change). 

	*	If only two codons were present, but the codon contained multiple hits, the intermediate 
		requiring the fewest number of nonsynonymous changes and no stop codons was assumed (e.g., 
		TTG(L) <--> CTG(L) <--> CTC(L) = 2 syn changes, TTG(L) <--> TTC(F) <--> CTC(L) = 1 syn, 1 
		nonsyn change, meaning the first scenario would be assumed). 

	*	If there were 2 or more differences in the codons of two difference species, but not all of 
		the changes were at invariant sites (i.e., at least one of the changes was polymorphic 
		within the species), it will be sent to the logfile for manual determination and only counted the 
		number of fixed differences in the final count.

BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE LOGFILE. IT IS THE DEFINITIVE OUTPUT. ALL COMPLEX CODONS ARE SENT THERE, BUT NOT 
INCLUDED IN OUTPUT TABLES
